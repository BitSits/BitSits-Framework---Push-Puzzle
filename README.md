Push-Puzzle

This is my first experimental game made in 4 days. I have tried to give a look of black board as if the puzzle is played on it.
The April theme for [Experimental Gameplay Projects](http://experimentalgameplay.com/) is [Wash, Rinse, and REPEAT](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2010/04/in-april-wash-rinse-and-repeat/).

You can slide the puzzle blocks using with mouse [LEFT BUTTON]. The top and the bottom block can slide vertically and side ones can slide horizontally.

But if you make a mess you have to repeat the level.
